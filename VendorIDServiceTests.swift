/* ****************************
Unit tests are a key component in all software development. In a services-based architecture
they are critical to ensure the services are working properly, and changes do not negatively impact
consumers of the service. 

Many times services may be entirely written using unit tests to exercise the code and do
development debugging. The first time a webapp interacts with your service may be during
integration testing.

There are many ways to write unit tests, and many methodologies of testing. For this example,
we'll focus on ensuring tests are both positive and negative, and demonstrate some of the
helpers we've included in the example PredixMobileReferenceAppTests target.
